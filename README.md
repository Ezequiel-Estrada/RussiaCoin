Russia Coin July 2017
*Year 3 Update:*
addnode=76.74.177.199

Version 1.2 was released on GitHub on the 12th of June 2017 while the website is in the process of getting a spring clean

*Quote 2017* Wallet Update - fixes issues eg with block chain downloads to prevent staking (*forking issues*) until whole block chain has downloaded.

Basically, because of the initial whales at launch there were multiple forks that occurred resulting in some issues with the block chain failing at various points eg 21,181 etc. The chain still downloads, but through a convoluted series of coding issues, *all* the various forks were downloaded.

This release fixes those issues.

Was hoping to launch the website on the first of July 2017, however, I have pushed through a partial update of the website.

On the To Do list are the various Windows / Mac / Linux versions to put through.
